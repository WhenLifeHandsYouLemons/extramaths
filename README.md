# extramaths
 A custom Python package that simplifies equations. Right now it only does quadratics and 2D shape areas, soon I'll add more.

 Go to https://pypi.org/project/extramaths/ to install the package.

## Help

### For Quadratics
 from extramaths import quadsolver

 value1, value2 = quadsolver.quadraticsolver(a, b, c)
